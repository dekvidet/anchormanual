# Anchormanual (Work in progress)

Comment agregator app that helps newscasters or streamers to connect with their audience during a livestream or show. It provides a dashboard to aggregate comments, e-mails and community feedbacks from different sources either manually or by automatic fetching via social APIs so it can be displayed neatly in a browser on a display or a tablet. Has remote support so community management can be handled by a crew behind the scenes while the anchorman sees only the results.
